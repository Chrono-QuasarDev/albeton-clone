            <h3>Making music isn't easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when you're in the flow, it's incredibly rewarding.</h3>
            <p>We feel the same way about making Albeton products. The driving force behind Albeton is our passion for what we make, and the people we make it for.</p>

            <h3>We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angelos and Tokyo.</h3>
            <p>Most of us are active musicians, and DJs, and many of us Live and Push every day. We came from a wide range of cultural and professional background. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.</p>

          <h3>We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments. We only work on a few products and we stive to make them great.</h3>
          <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our poeple what they need to work their magic and grow. We've learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perpspectives. We don't always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>
